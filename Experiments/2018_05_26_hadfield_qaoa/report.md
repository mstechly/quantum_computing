# Hadfield QAOA

## Introduction

The goal of this experiment was to implement version of QAOA more suited for bounded problems like TSP. It's description is in the `resources` directory.

## Dependencies

As a main engine for solving TSP I'm code from this repository: https://github.com/BOHRTECHNOLOGY/quantum_tsp, imported as a subtree.

I was using pyquil and grove.
Pyquil: commit hash: `26ae363e9f5c85dc3aab298daebc9ec5023a32a1`
Grove: commit hash: `e3fd7b9f3188e820dd19ff487dbf56c8faf43822`

The exact versions of these repositories are commited to this project.
